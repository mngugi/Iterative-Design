# Iterative-Design

## 🌀 Iterative Design Process Experience

The **iterative design process** has been a cornerstone in many of my projects, particularly those focused on **user-centered digital solutions**. This approach allows for constant evolution based on feedback, testing, and stakeholder input.

### 🛠️ Prioritizing Feedback & Making Incremental Changes

1. **Gather Diverse Feedback**
   - I collect feedback from **target users**, **stakeholders**, and **developers** via usability testing, surveys, and direct interviews.
   - I categorize this feedback into:
     - 🔴 **Critical blockers** (issues that break functionality or prevent use)
     - 🟡 **Medium-priority suggestions** (usability improvements)
     - 🟢 **Nice-to-haves** (cosmetic or optional enhancements)

2. **Evaluate Against Goals**
   - Each suggestion is assessed against the **project’s core goals**, timeline, and resource availability.
   - I maintain a **design change log** to track iterations, decisions, and rationale.

3. **Rapid Prototyping**
   - I use tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or even code-based prototypes (React/HTML) to test incremental changes.
   - A/B testing or internal reviews are conducted after each round.

### ✅ Example Project: AI Learning Platform for Primary Students in Kenya

**Problem:**  
We were building a digital learning platform tailored for students in Grades 3 to 6. Initial testing revealed major issues in:
- Content accessibility
- Onboarding flow
- Engagement with interactive lessons

**How Iteration Helped:**
- **Round 1 (Paper Prototypes):**
  - Feedback: Children found the navigation confusing.
  - Fix: Added visual breadcrumbs and large icons.

- **Round 2 (Clickable Figma Mockups):**
  - Feedback: Reading levels were too high.
  - Fix: Rewrote all instructions to suit Grade 3 reading level, added audio support.

- **Round 3 (Code Prototype with Limited Module):**
  - Feedback: Students wanted rewards and teachers wanted monitoring.
  - Fix: Introduced gamification (badges, stars) and a real-time teacher dashboard.

**Result:**  
The final product saw a **30% increase in lesson completion rates**, and teacher feedback scores improved from **2.8/5 to 4.6/5**.

### 🧗 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                                      | Solution                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Balancing scope creep with valuable feedback  | Defined a strict iteration cap and used a voting system with stakeholders to decide changes |
| Limited access to test users (students)       | Partnered with a local school to run scheduled feedback sessions |
| Technical constraints (e.g., offline access)  | Adjusted design to support progressive web app features and local storage |

### 🔁 Final Thoughts

Iterative design is not just about revisions—it's about **learning, adapting, and evolving** toward the best user experience possible. The key is to balance feedback with feasibility and always prioritize the user's voice.
